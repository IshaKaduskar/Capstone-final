             <p>Climate change is a worldwide problem that is the rising or falling of tempratures due to carbon and fossil fuels. This can cause extereme weathers, and it is not good.</p>
             <br>
             <p>This is effecting manny people throuout the world.</p>
             <br>
             <p>Many people are trying to stop climate change. America's new 
                 president is a big enviormentalist, and is doing many things to 
                 stop it, like stoping the oil Keystone Pipline, thats getting transported
                 from Canada, Alberta. I know a lot about this action that the president
                 has made, since I live in Alberta.
             </p>
             <br>
             <p>Our premier, Jason Kenney, is against this choice.</p>
             <br>
             <p>In climate change, everyone has different opinions on what we should be doing.
                 This is one of the reasons why climate change is a big problem. With all of these different opinions,
                how can we all decide on one thing to do? Some people also think that climate change is not real.</p>
